Hi my friends!
Recently I have migrated my blog (this one you are reading from Wordpress.com to Jekyll + GitHub pages).

I really like how easy is to modify your content, format or just to publish a new post on the blog.
With wordpress.com, one of the problems I had was to find an easy way to elaborate a post including content, images, formatting everything properly and so on.

One option was to use wordpress.com web interface or else some 3rd party tools like the ones considered here
[Wordpress.com Blogging Tools](http://sisteming.github.io/2014/05/25/wordpress-com-blogging-tools/).

With the new approach using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages, I can just open my favourite text editor (or a markdown editor to make it easier) and just generate my content, easily add links or images and just commit to my github to have it published on my blog.

I am really liking this new way of blogging and I would like to thank [@dottorblaster](http://dottorblaster.it/2014/09/addio-wordpress-benvenuto-jekyll/) as thank to his blog, I discovered the Jekyll world ;)
