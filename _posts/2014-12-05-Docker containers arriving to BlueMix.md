title: Docker containers arriving to Bluemix!
---

Hello my friends!

Just two days ago I was posting a blog about Docker, what it is and why many companies seem to like it: 

[What is Docker and why everyone likes it](http://sisteming.github.io/2014/12/03/What%20is%20Docker%20and%20why%20everyone%20likes%20it%3F/)

Well, there are more fresh news... Just today, at DockerCon Europe, Docker and IBM announced the container service on Bluemix, based on Docker!

The idea, based on the service description on BlueMix, is the following:


***The IBM Containers Service enables you to run Docker containers in a hosted cloud environment, on IBM Bluemix. Port your existing applications to IBM Bluemix and make them publically accessible by using containers. A private registry is provided where trusted images can be uploaded, stored and retrieved.***


For more details on how to start using this, just head over to this article by Jason McGee on DeveloperWorks or have a look at the video linked below:
