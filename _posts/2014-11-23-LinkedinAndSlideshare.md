title: Create your Professional Journey using Linkedin and Slideshare
---

Hi my friends! 

I hope you are all good and enjoying the last hours of the weekend!

I was having a look on Linkedin and I saw that some of my contacts had this thing from Linkedin and Slideshare that shows your Professional Journey in a very nice visual way.

Basically it is getting the information from your Linkedin profile and building a nice gesture based presentation that can be share, on Linkedin, Twitter or other social networks.

Well, if you want to try go just go here: [Professional Journey with Linkedin and Slideshare](http://lnkd.in/daVcsMK)

This is the result for me in case you are curious...
