title: Jolla presents a crowdfunded tablet based on SailfishOS
---



What a day has been for Jolla! 
Some days ago a countdown was published on jolla.com for today, at the time Marc Dillon was going to speak at Slush14.

As a Jolla owner since the beginning, and following them since the Nokia N9 with Meego and the N900 with Maemo, I was waiting to see what could they announce.

There were many rumours, a second phone, a phablet or a tablet... Well, in the end a tablet was!

I saw yesterday presentation by Nokia and even if I'm happy to see them back without Microsoft around, the presentation and the tablet doesn't have much interest to me...

That was not the case when Marc Dillon was on stage today. You can feel the passion he gives to each product, each presentation or each event. The presentation was really good, summarizing all what Jolla has done so far in the last year. And then, just presented a video where he presented the new Jolla tablet based on SailfishOS 2.0

The two real news of this presentation was:
* 	First tablet to be based on SailfishOS (I know about the dream of having a tablet with Meego...)
* 	First table to be crowdfunded by people, by the community supporting Jolla and SailfishOS.
	
But not only this... Jolla met its target for the crowdfunded Jolla Tablet in less than 3 hours...
