**What is Docker?**

What is Docker? From their own definition at [https://www.docker.com/company/aboutus/](https://www.docker.com/company/aboutus/)


*...Docker is an open platform for building, shipping and running distributed applications. Docker provides a platform that enables any application to be created and run as a collection of consistent, low-overhead Docker containers that work across virtually any infrastructure.*

That sounds cool isn't it?

Nowadays we hear that more and more companies are starting to use it or to integrate with Docker and its container world. Companies like VMware, IBM, Yelp, Spotify, ebay and others are looking at this project and trying to integrate it accross different solutions.

But what are the use cases for Docker? How can it help?
Well, again, the docker website is the best source to get some information on this:
