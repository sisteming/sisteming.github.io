Hello, my dear my friends!

I know it has been so long since my last post on this blog. At least 7 months, which is definitely not good.

But you know, life is life and things happened... This year won't be on my best years list for sure. There have been ups and downs, but for now the downs are a majority. 

But let's keep this positive. If you check my [last post](http://sisteming.github.io/2015/04/01/MongoDB%20on%20BlueMix/), I mentioned this:


> For some reasons that I will explain in a future post, I have been looking at MongoDB and I was curious about its availability on BlueMix.


Well, I think the time has arrived to explain this. 

As you know, in the past, some of my recent posts here were related to IBM cloud technologies like Bluemix, dashDB or Cloudant. If you see my previous post, I was exploring the MongoDB service on Bluemix... (hint hint ;))

That's one of the positive sides of this year: I changed from working with IBM and being involved in Bluemix and the IM solutions in IBM, to working for MongoDB, **THE** noSQL open-source database.

Working for MongoDB is being a great experience so far, both for the size of the company, the way things work and specially for the kind of work we do in our team: helping clients to be successful deploying MongoDB.

This involves lots of log analysis, infrastructure review, dealing with code, Linux, performance... All things I always liked.

So yeah, that's it. You're now up to date!

Keep looking at the blog for new and fresh posts in the near future!

Take care guys!

Marco
