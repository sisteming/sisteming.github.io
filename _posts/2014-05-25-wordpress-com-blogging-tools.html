<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Hi!</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">	</span>I know my blog has not been so in use since 2012â€¦ But recently I have been thinking about trying to write more on it.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">	</span>One of the problems I had was that the interface on wordpress.com to edit / publish new posts is not so useful or simple, at least for&nbsp;me. I have been looking for editing tools for blogs and now I have found some interesting options to analyze here:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">	</span><b>Mac OS X:</b></p></p>
<ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>PixelPumper (Available on AppStore): http://www.pixelpumper.com</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div><img src="assets/wpid-wpid-pixel-pumper.jpg" height="348" width="500" /></div>
<p></div>
<ul>
<li>Bits (Available on AppStore):&nbsp;http://bitsapp.info</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Linux:</b></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Blogilo (KDE)</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>I will try them all to see which one is more complete, but for now on Mac OS X PixelPumper seems to be really nice. It has autocorrect options and the interface is easy to use.</div></p>
