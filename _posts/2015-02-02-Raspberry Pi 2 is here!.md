title: Raspberry Pi 2 is here!
---

Hello my friends!

Wow, I personally didn't expect it, but today a new Raspberry Pi has been launched!
And no, it's not just an improvement like the B+ model... this is something more..

### Raspberry Pi 2

What is new?

The specifications:

- 900 MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU 
- 1GB LPDDR2 SDRAM
- Full compatibility with Raspberry Pi (cases and accesories!)

You can have a look at the full specifications here:

The specifications are great right? What about the price?
A key point for the original Raspberry Pi was the price. 
 
So is the price still good enough for this new Raspberry Pi? Absolutely...

35... **35$**. What? For the new Raspberry Pi 2. Yes, you read right. 
Like they say... *shut up and take my money!!!* :)

Interested in getting one? You can try one of these two sites for Europe:

[Pimoroni Shop](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-2-with-pibow)

[RS Components](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/832-6274/)


I will try to get one soon to play a bit and see how good it is compared to the original.

Expect also a technical comparison between its ARM Cortex A7 (quad core) and the ARM Cortex A9 (dual core) that powered the Pandaboard that I used [here](http://sisteming.github.io/2012/02/20/low-power-techniques-in-multicore-systems-based-in-arm-architecture-part-iii/)

As a last note, it seems that Microsoft is trying hard to change their image... and there will be a Windows 10 version to run on the new Raspberry Pi 2!!! A move to try to avoid Linux spreading? Maybe... But fair play to MS!

Anyone ordering one? Feel free to comment with what use you could make of it!
