<p>My name is Marco, I'm a Computer Science Engineer who likes the world of open source, Linux and having fun with databases.<br />
Actually IÂ´m working as PureData Systems for Transactions Specialist so I have the opportunity to have a lot of fun with clustered databases, high availability and performance testing.</p>
<p>In October 2011 I finished my Master Degree focused in Embedded Systems and Computer Networks. I enjoyed using FPGAs, Xilinx and programming in VHDL, but I prefer using embedded Linux in ARM platforms. In fact, my Master Thesis was about Low Power in multicore ARM architecture and I also did a project with an ARM embedded board and MythTV.</p>
<p>I'm also interested in Archlinux, smartphones, embedded Linux and most of the open source projects. </p>
