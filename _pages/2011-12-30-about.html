<p>My name is Marco Bonezzi, I'm a Msc. who likes the world of open source, Linux and having fun with databases.</p>


As of today (and for the last 5+years) I'm working in MongoDB, as a Manager in Technical Services. It has been lots of fun in MongoDB and growing from an individual contributor role to a role where I try to help more people as we grow our teams.</p>

<p>In October 2011 I finished my Master Degree focused in Embedded Systems and Computer Networks. I enjoyed using FPGAs, Xilinx and programming in VHDL, but I prefer using embedded Linux in ARM platforms. In fact, my Master Thesis was about Low Power in multicore ARM architecture and I also did a project with an ARM embedded board and MythTV.</p>
<p>I'm also interested in Archlinux, smartphones, embedded Linux and most of the open source projects. </p>
