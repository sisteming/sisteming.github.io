Here I am supposed to write some information about me, right?
Well, it will be very short: 

*My name is Marco, I work in IT and I am mainly focused on databases and other technologies all around data. 
I also love to play with smartphones and I like Linux and Open Source projects as well.* *In my own time I use to play with embedded devices like Raspberry Pi, Arduino or Pandaboard and do my own mini-projects.*

<<<<<<< HEAD
In this blog I am writing my own personal view on some aspects of IT or just on few things I may be working with.
=======
A place to include any other types of information that you'd like to include about yourself.
